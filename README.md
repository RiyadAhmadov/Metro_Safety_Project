**Introduction**

The subway (railway) is a vital mode of transportation, but it can also pose significant risks to human life. To address this concern, we need to examine the statistics related to metro-related fatalities.

**Metro Death Statistics (2021)**

- Total railroad deaths in 2021: 893, marking a 20% increase from the revised total of 744 in 2020 and the highest number since 2007.
- Nonfatal injuries in 2021: 5,781, representing a 4% increase from the revised total of 5,544 in 2020.
- Fatalities at highway-rail crossings increased by 21% from 2020 to 2021.
- Fatalities involving other types of incidents increased by 20%, with 617 deaths (94%) attributed to trespassers.
- Eleven employees lost their lives while on duty, matching the 2020 death toll.
- Train passenger deaths numbered six in 2021, up from two in 2020.

**Project Objective**

In response to these concerning statistics, we propose the Underground Safety Project. The primary aim of this project is to reduce the number of deaths and accidents in subway systems. We introduce the concept of a "security line" in front of the subway and implement a system to detect individuals moving within this designated area.

**Project Implementation**

- **Security Line**: We designate a specific area in front of the subway as the "security line."

- **Person Detection**: Using advanced technology, we implement a person-detection system to monitor and detect individuals within the security line.

- **Warning System**: When the system detects movement within the security line, a warning light is activated. This warning light serves as an early alert to prevent potential accidents and ensure passenger safety.

By proactively identifying and warning about individuals in the security line, we aim to prevent accidents and enhance the overall safety of subway passengers.

Join us in making subway transportation safer for everyone!
